# Real-time-Fire-Detection-Using-CNN
A Real Time Fire Detection Using Convolution Neural Network(CNN) and openCV written in Python Using keras Library  

  The motivation for an image processing based approach is due to rapid growth of the electronics. Fire detection systems are one of the most important components in surveillance systems used to monitor buildings and environment as part of an early warning mechanism that reports preferably the start of fire. Currently, almost all fire detection systems use built-in sensors that primarily depend on the reliability and the positional distribution of the sensors. The sensors should be distributed densely for a high precision fire detector system. In a sensor-based fire detection system, coverage of large areas in outdoor applications is impractical due to the requirement of regular distribution of sensors in close proximity. Due to the rapid developments in digital camera technology and video processing techniques, there is a big trend to replace conventional fire detection techniques with computer vision-based systems.
  
# OBJECTIVES
•	The main objective of most fire detection and alarm signalling systems is detecting a fire early so as to initiate various actions. Being able to adequately assess the time when an initiating device may activate is therefore important, especially when undertaking a performance-based assessment and the overall development of a fire safety strategy.

•	The main aim is to provide a general overview of the image processing-based analysis and design process and highlights the benefits. This approach brings to the performance-based design of fire detection systems.

•	The primary is usually the building's main public electrical connection, which must be connected at a fire detection and alarm system dedicated branch circuit.
